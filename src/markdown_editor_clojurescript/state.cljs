An h1 header
============

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.

> They can span multiple paragraphs,

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., \"it's all
                         in chapters 12--14\"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. ☺

An h2 header
------------

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

~~~python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
~~~
"))
